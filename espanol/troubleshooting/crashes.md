## My game crashes on boot.
* You probably installed the [**[High Memory File]**](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/advancedstuff/#intro) and forgot to enable "Debug Console Mode" in the [[Advanced tab when setting up the Custom Configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration/#advanced) for Rock Band 3.
* If it's not this, you have a bad dump or an incompatible computer.

## My game crashes when practicing on regular guitar/bass.
* You didn't read the guide and did not install Rock Band 3 Deluxe, which fixes this.

## Scrolling through the library has long pauses.
* You didn't read the guide and did not set the "Network Status" to "Connected" in the [[Network tab when setting up the Custom Configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#network) for Rock Band 3.

## [Rock Band 3 Deluxe] "I crash in the intro video.
* You have incompatible Rock Band 3 Deluxe files. You need to go to Rock Band 3's game directory in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR` and delete every `.dta` file aside from `dx_high_memory.dta`.
 * If you still have this issue, redownload Rock Band 3 Deluxe as Github sometimes doesn't download correctly.

## I followed every step and my game is crashing/performing horribly!
* Double check to make sure you meet the requirements and have followed every step correctly. This guide has been thoroughly tested and has been proven to work by many people with varying degrees of hardware. If you are absolutely sure you followed every step correctly, it is 90% likely that the dump of the game you have is bad, a 9% chance your computer ran out of disk space or doesn't meet the minimum specs, and 1% chance it's a skill issue. If you wish, contact me on [**[the Milohax discord]**](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/discord) for advice.
