## I can't find a 3rd or 4th player when searching
* Port 9103 is blocked. You can either enable UPNP in Rock Band 3's [[Network]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#network) configuration or manually forward port 9103 (UDP) in your firewall. **Don't enable UPNP while port forwarding** as this can cause crashes.
* Rock Band 3 online lobbies can only have 2 slots of Guitar/Bass/Keys, one Drums slot, and one Vocal slot.
	* If you want to bypass this, go to 
	Options > Deluxe Settings > Advanced > Controller > Change Controller Type

## I'm stuck on "Registering Account" when trying to connect to online servers.
* Make sure you have copied the correct settings in the Rock Band 3's [[Network]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#network) configuration.
* You may have lost connection to RPCN  and will have to restart the game. If you continue to get this after restart, close out Rock Band 3, go to the top menu in RPCS3, "Configuration" > "RPCN" > "Account" > "Test Account" then restart the game to force a reconnection.
 
## I keep disconnecting constantly while playing online.
* Double check to make sure your connection is stable. Try connecting via Ethernet cable if possible. If you have increased your VBlank past 60 Hz, set it back to 60 Hz. Aside from that, there's not much that can be done aside from getting better internet.

## My customs aren't showing up in lobbies even though my lobby have the same customs.
* Please read the [**[PS3 Customs guide]**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YwGNT1oPUgfek-p3sLCZv4b-PsO8Yv9eobx5fV6W2vQ/edit#heading=h.qxzngdakbkv) section on this.
