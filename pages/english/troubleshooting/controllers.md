                                This seems to vary by controller. Try using the whammy or effects switch if you have it. I’d also suggest doing any sort of character customization on a typing keyboard or a regular game controller as some instrument controllers don’t have enough buttons to use the on-screen keyboard. You can also try disabling the Native Interface as mentioned in <a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#emulator">[the Emulator section of Custom Configuration]</a>.
