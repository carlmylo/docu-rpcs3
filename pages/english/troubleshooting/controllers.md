                                This seems to vary by controller. Try using the whammy or effects switch if you have it. I’d also suggest doing any sort of character customization on a typing keyboard or a regular game controller as some instrument controllers don’t have enough buttons to use the on-screen keyboard. You can also try disabling the Native Interface as mentioned in <a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#emulator">[the Emulator section of Custom Configuration]</a>.

## [Pro Drums] My E-Kit doesn't work
* Windows doesn't let programs share MIDI devices. If you have anything else open that is using the port (including MIDI Monitor), close it before starting Rock Band 3 in RPCS3.
* Make sure your E-Kit is mapped correctly and on the right channel. Refer to [[the MIDI Drums page]](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/ctrls_drums_midi) for more help.
