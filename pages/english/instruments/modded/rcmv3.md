## Setup

If you haven't initlized your Wii Adapter yet, start up RetroCultMod's Programming Tool.

In the start screen, select your Device. It will usually show up as "`Raspberry Pi Pico`".
After that, select "`Wii Adapter`" as your Device Type.
Then finally, set Device Variant to "RCM Wii Guitar Adapter - Default". **You don't need Auth, Slider, or Joystick** support.

"Selected Device" is set to Raspberry Pi Pico, "Device Type" is set to "Wii Adapter", and Device Variant is set to "RCM Wii Guitar Adapter - Default."](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/instruments/xtra/rcmpt/initv3.png "RetroCultMods Programming Tool")

After that, click on Erase and configure and wait for the progress bar to finish.

When it finishes, click on Configure.

In Controller Settings, set your configuration to the following:
* Swap Switch Face Buttons: (Depends on your guitar)
* Windows Controller Mode: HID Game Controller
* Slider Bar: (Depends on your guitar)
* Tilt: Enabled

It's also suggested you calibrate your Whammy to have the best experience. Scroll down to the Wii Extension Inputs and calibrate it.

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON "`Save Setting"`" before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

## Mappings

* **To map everything correctly, you will need to first map Whammy Down, which is Right Stick: Left in RPCS3. It should show up as X-. After mapping it, click `"Filter Noise"` and map the rest.**

### Passthrough Mode

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>As of writing this, RPCS3 does not support hotplugging, which means you cannot plug your guitar in AFTER starting RPCS3. Passthrough Mode lets you use your guitar without needing to bind anything but due to the lack of hotplugging (PS3/Emulator preset), you need to start the game up twice. Therefore, this mode is currently not recommended. </b> {{include.content}}</div>
