## NOTES

* There is no binding file.
* **Do NOT map this instrument via Gamepad Configuration.**
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) will cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a typing keyboard or a gamepad.
* This is meant for players that have their PRO Guitars connected via a MIDI to USB interface.

## SYSEX Notice

**You need a MIDI to USB Interface that has SYSEX support!** Consult your MIDI to USB interface's manual or manufacturer for more details.

| Verified <br> MIDI to USB interfaces |

| **M-Audio** <br> Midisport Uno |
| **Roland** <br> UM-ONE mk2 |
| **Focusrite** <br> Scarlett (4i4 and higher) [3rd Gen] |

## Instructions:

Since you can't use the dongle, you will need to connect Rock Band 3 Pro Guitar via the MIDI port on the bottom.

**To connect it to your computer, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.

Here's an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity. **To check that you've plugged it in correctly, you should see "MIDI In" blinking when you press a key**.

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs. For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.

Once again, you need [[a MIDI to USB Interface that has SYSEX support]](#sysex-notice)

Find whichever way is the most convenient for you then connect your Rock Band Pro Guitar to your computer.

After that, **right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on ‚Äú**Change Custom Configuration**‚Äù.
