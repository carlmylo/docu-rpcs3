Thanks to the talented crew at RBEnhanced, the GoCentral project has revived Rock Band 3's online mode. This part will be going over how to get the most out of your experience while playing online.

## Inviting Friends

Before sending or receiving invites, make sure you're online. For that, open the Start menu and press on "Play on GoCentral" to go online.

**Select any name.** It doesn't matter as **the actual friend you're sending an invite to will be on the next screen.**

**Here's where you actually select the friend you want to send an invite to.**

You will be asked to confirm if you want to send the message. **Press "Yes" to send it.**

Once your friend accepts the invite, they'll be in your session.

## Searching for random people

Searching for random players works just like it did originally

**Go to Play Now > Quick Play > Find GoCentral Players**

That's it! You should soon find other players!
