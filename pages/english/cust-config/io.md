**This section is for people playing with USB/MIDI Keyboards, Pro Guitars, or MIDI Drums!**
* **If you're not playing with a wired Pro Guitar, Pro Drums, or a USB/MIDI keyboard,** [[**skip** over **this section**].](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/custom_config_net)  
* **If you're playing with a PS3 Rock Band 3 Keyboard or wireless PS3 Mustang Pro Guitar,** [[**skip** over **this section**].](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/custom_config_net)  

**Make sure your MIDI instrument is connected.** After that, let's go ahead and **focus on RPCS3's I/O tab.**
**YOU MAY HAVE TO MAKE THE WINDOW WIDER TO READ THE OPTIONS!**

* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smallblue.png "Tan Square") **Performance Tweaks**: 
	* **Change "Pad Handler Mode" to "Multi-threaded"** - May help with thread distribution, leading to more even performance. Your mileage may vary.

* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **Recommended**: 
	* üéπ **MIDI Keyboard Players: Leave your "Emulated MIDI type" on "Keyboard" and select your keyboard or MIDI interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
	* üé∏ **MIDI Pro Guitar Players: Change your "Emulated MIDI type" from "Keyboard" to "Guitar (17 Frets)" if you have a Mustang Pro Guitar, or "Guitar (22 Frets)" if you have a Squier Pro Guitar, then select your MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
	* ü•Å **MIDI Pro Drums Players: Change your "Emulated MIDI type" from "Keyboard" to "Drums", then select your Electronic MIDI Drum Kit or MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.
	* **Enable "Keep Pads Connected"** - This can help fix a problem with instrument controllers soft-locking the game when RPCS3 interfaces, such as the RPCN invites, come up.
