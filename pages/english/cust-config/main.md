summary: "What to change for Rock Band 3 in RPCS3's Custom Configuration"
---

While a Quick Configuration should work in most cases, some things require additional settings, like microphones and MIDI instruments. This involves creating or editing a Custom Configuration for Rock Band 3.

<ul id="confeditTabs" class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a href="#changecustomconfig" data-toggle="tab">Changing a Custom Configuration</a></li>
    <li><a href="#createcustomconfig" data-toggle="tab">Creating a Custom Configuration</a></li>
</ul>
  <div class="tab-content">
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="changecustomconfig">
<p>If you're editing a Custom Configuration (like the one you installed from Quick Configuration), <strong>right click on Rock Band 3</strong> in RPCS3, then click on “<strong>Change Custom Configuration</strong>”.<br>

</div>
<br/>

**Don't forget to click "Apply" then "Save custom configuration" after adjusting settings!**  
Keep in mind that you'll have to restart the game for most of these settings.

## Color Guide

This may seem overwhelming because of the sheer number of options, but I have color-coded the settings that require adjustment. Anything not colored **should be left on defaults**.

| COLOR | MEANING |
|---|---|
| ![A green square with a dashed outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/biggreen.png "Green Square") | **REQUIRED** |
| ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/bigblue.png "Blue Square") | **Performance Tweaks** |
| ![A tan square with a solid outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/bigtan.png "Tan Square") | **Recommended** |

<li><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smallblue.png" alt="A blue square with a dotted outline." title="Tan Square"> <strong>Improved performance, depending on machine</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Change “SPU Block Size” to “Mega”</strong> - Ties smaller SPU compiled together, which can help machines with fewer cores/threads. Drastically speeds up game startup time on certain machines.</li>
<li><strong>Change “Preferred SPU Threads” to “1”, “2”, “3”, or “4”</strong> - May help prevent stutter caused by CPU overloads on systems with fewer cores/threads. <strong>Start at 4 and lower it one by one until it improves</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Change “Thread Scheduler” to “RPCS3 Scheduler”, or “RPCS3 Alternative Scheduler”</strong> - <strong>FOR CPUs WITH 12+ THREADS ONLY!</strong> May help with thread distribution to prevent microstutters.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smallgreen.png" alt="A green square with a dashed outline." title="Green Square"> <strong>REQUIRED</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable “Write Color Buffers”</strong> - Characters will have severe graphical bugs without this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smallblue.png" alt="A blue square with a dotted outline." title="Blue Square"> <strong>Tweak depending on graphics card</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable “VSync”</strong> - Reduces screen tearing and may lead to a more stable framerate. Slightly increases input latency. <strong>Do not enable this with the frame limiter</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Change "Frame Limit"</strong>
<ul>
<li>Set it to “Off” to use higher VBlank Frequencies, which may introduce jitter, <strong>or if you're using VSync.</strong></li>
<li>Auto will use default RPCS3 settings.</li>
<li>It is suggested to use your graphics driver's settings or software like MSI Afterburner to limit your framerate instead.</li>
<li>Adjusting the frame rate to be higher than 60 exponentially uses more resources, so this is not recommended for low end machines.</li>
<li>Be aware that framerates higher than 60 may cause the vocal pitch detection to behave incorrectly.</li>
<li>It's suggested to disable VSync within Rock Band 3 Deluxe itself in <br> <code>Menu &gt; Options &gt; Deluxe Settings &gt; Graphics &gt; VSync</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Change “ZCULL Accuracy” to “Relaxed”</strong> - Provides a slight performance improvement but may cause graphical anomalies in very rare situations.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust “Anistropic Filter”</strong> to depending on what your GPU can handle. Increase for better texture filtering. Performance impact should be negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust “Resolution Scale”</strong> to preference and to what your computer can handle. Increase for sharper graphics at the cost of higher GPU requirements. This forces the game to run at this resolution. Lowering this below 100% isn't worth it as it won't give much, if any, framerate gains.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust “Output Scaling”</strong> to preference and to what your computer can handle. This affects how the game is “blown up” in size when fitting to your monitor's native resolution. Helpful for those keeping Resolution Scale (mentioned above) at 100% while playing on a monitor larger than 1280x720.
<ul>
<li>“Nearest” is completely unfiltered and gives you a raw unmodified image. This can cause the game to look pixelated.</li>
<li>“Bilinear” uses smoothing to scale the image up. This may cause the game to look blurry.</li>
<li>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) uses complicated math to sharpen and enhance the image when it gets blown up to your monitor's resolution. This can create odd artifacts in some instances.
<ul>
<li>You can use “RCAS Sharpening Strength” below to adjust the strength of its effect.</li>

<p><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smallblue.png" alt="A blue square with a dotted outline." title="Blue Square"> <strong>Tweak depending on audio hardware and CPU</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust “Audio Buffer Duration”</strong> depending on system. Ideally you want this as low as possible.
<ul>
<li>Lower values give you less audio latency but use more CPU.</li>
<li>Higher values give you more audio latency but use less CPU.</li>
<li>Vocalists are affected the most by this, as a higher latency creates a distracting echo. Instrument players can use calibration to compensate regardless of audio buffer setting.</li>
<li>You can change this while the game is running, but it will require re-calibrating in Rock Band 3’s system settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Change “Audio Out” to “XAudio2” in extremely rare circumstances</strong> - <strong>Most users should stay on Cubeb</strong>, a few users have experienced better performance with XAudio2. Only do this if you absolutely need to!</li>

<li>
<p><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smallblue.png" alt="A blue square with a dotted outline." title="Tan Square"> <strong>Depending on your computer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust VBlank Frequency</strong> if you want a higher internal framerate. This can make it easier to hit notes but may cause graphical instability and connection issues while online. <strong>It's best left alone</strong> and not recommended to go above 75 Hz if adjusting it for online play. Increasing it exponentially uses more CPU and GPU.
<ul>
<li>Once again, having a higher VBlank can cause issues with vocal detection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Change “Maximum Number of SPURS Threads”</strong> - May improve performance on older systems with less cores and threads <a href="https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/issues/12#issue-1955946005" target="_blank">[like 4th gen Intel i5 CPUs with 4 cores and 4 threads]</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Enable “Debug Console Mode”</strong> - Enabling this and “Large Heap” in Rock Band 3 Deluxe will allow Rock Band 3  to have more memory.

Everyone should enable this! <a href="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/adv_himem" target="_blank">[Click here for more information.]</a></li>
<li><strong>Change “Exclusive Fullscreen Mode” to “Prefer borderless fullscreen”</strong> to prevent potential crashes and audio desync when changing from Rock Band 3 to another program while in fullscreen.</li>

<p><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/emulator.png" alt="A screenshot of Rock Band 3's Emulator custom settings, showing &quot;Show trophy popups&quot;, &quot;Show PPU compilation hint&quot;, &quot;Show Shader Compilation hint&quot;, &quot;Start Games in fullscreen mode&quot;, &quot;Use native user interface.&quot;" title="Emulator"></p>
<p>You can leave this as is if you want, but I would consider changing the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/smalltan.png" alt="A tan square with a solid outline." title="Tan Square"> <strong>Optional tweaks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>"Show trophy popups"</strong> - Mimics the way Trophy notifications appear on the PS3. I personally disable this as the game has its own pop-ups.</li>
<li><strong>"Show PPU compilation hint"</strong> - This creates a popup whenever RPCS3 is compiling units for the PPU. This only comes up once as the “Recompiler (LLVM)” setting in the CPU tab does this when launching the game.</li>
<li><strong>"Show shader compilation hint"</strong> - This creates a popup whenever RPCS3 is compiling shaders. Whether you leave it on or not is up to you, but I should tell you what this means as it is important. When you run PS3 games, it has to compile shaders to “translate” the graphics from a PS3 format to a format your PC can work with. <strong>The game will</strong> appear to <strong>stutter when this happens</strong>. <strong>This happens on ALL computer systems. When it finishes</strong> compiling an effect, <strong>it will usually never happen again</strong>. <strong>The best way to deal with this is</strong> just <strong>to</strong> <strong>play the game</strong> as it will quickly go away. You can also use Rock Band 3 Deluxe's Autoplay modifier to let it go through a few songs in party shuffle and let it compile a decent amount of shaders.</li>
<li><strong>"Start games in Fullscreen mode"</strong> - Switches to Fullscreen when you start Rock Band 3.</li>
<li><strong>"Use Native Interface"</strong> - Removes the pretty displays RPCS3 adds, including notifications and game startup background. It will instead use old school pop-ups. This can also fix a problem with instrument controllers soft locking the game when the keyboard comes up. The native interface also seems to cause slight frame rate drops.</li>
</ul>
