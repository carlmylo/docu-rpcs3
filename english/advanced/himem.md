We'll be adding increased memory support to Rock Band 3 on RPCS3. This is strongly suggested and allows for better stability as well top of increasing the song limit up to 16000.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>If you downloaded and are using a [[Quick Configurations profile,]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/quickconfiguration/) this is already active and you don't need to do this. </b> {{include.content}}</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <b>You need to [[enable Debug Console Mode in the Advanced Custom Configuration tab for Rock Band 3]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#advanced). Not doing this will cause your game to crash immediately after adding this file!! </b> {{include.content}}</div>

First, you'll need to [[download the file to enable increased memory support. Click here to download it]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/main/config/customconfig/memory.zip)

**After downloading the .zip file, extract its contents and move them to RPCS3's folder. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.**

In the GIF example below, the `devhdd_0` folder from the archive (memory.zip) was extracted and its contents were moved into RPCS3's folder.

![A GIF of "dev_hdd0" from "memory.zip" being moved into its proper location in RPCS3's folder.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/himem.gif "memory.zip")

That's it! Enjoy the increased stability and extra song space!
