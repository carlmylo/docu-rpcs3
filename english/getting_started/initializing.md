Now, **go to the folder where you extracted RPCS3.** Keep this folder open in the background. **Open up RPCS3**. **Tick "I have read the Quickstart guide" and "Do not show again", then click "Continue."**

**Drag** the **PS3UPDAT.PUP** file you just downloaded from Sony's website **into RPCS3**.

**Click "Yes"** when the firmware installer prompts you.

**Let it install.**

**When it finishes, click "OK."**

It will start compiling modules to load the PS3 XMB into the emulator, which may take a few minutes. **You can either let it do its thing or close it.**

Next, **open a new file browser window. Now go to the folder where you have your copy of Rock Band 3 stored and drag the folder into RPCS3's "games" folder**. Again, you're on your own when it comes to finding a copy. [[I used "PS3 Disc Dumper" for this because it's the easiest way]](https://youtu.be/mRxSKxoYt_g).

After dragging it in, click "Refresh" in RPCS3.

![A GIF of "Refresh" being clicked in RPCS3, which updates it to display Rock Band 3 in the game list.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/inst/rpcs3refresh.gif "Rock Band 3 [BLUS30463]")

After Rock Band 3 appears in your library, go get [**[*Rock Band 3 Deluxe*]**](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/).

This is a must-have mod, which also fixes some critical bugs RPCS3 has with Rock Band 3. On top of that, it adds [**[many great features]**](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/features).

[**[Click here to download Rock Band 3 Deluxe]**](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/downloads).

[![Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip archive in Edge's download tray.](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/downloads "RB3DX-PS3.zip")

**When it's finished downloading, extract the archive**.

**When it finishes extracting, drag the PKG file into RPCS3 and click "Yes"** on the prompt, just like you did earlier with the PS3UPDAT.PUP file.

If it installed successfully, you should see that the Rock Band 3 icon has changed.

You can also rename the game in the list to "Rock Band 3 Deluxe" if you wish. To do this, right-click on "Rock Band 3" and select "Rename In Game List."
