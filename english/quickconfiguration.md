## About

These files are meant for those that just want to play with minimal setup. It is still strongly suggested that you do [[custom configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/quickconfiguration/) to tweak to what's best for your computer.  
[[**Rock Band 3 Deluxe must be installed**]](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/) but if it's not already installed, you're not reading this guide and should go back and read it.  

Players who want to use [[microphones]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#audio), [[Wired Pro Guitar and USB/MIDI Keyboards]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/controllers/#keyboards), [[Electronic Drum Kits]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/instruments/misc/mididrums), or [[PS3 Mustang guitars or RB3 Keyboards with dongles]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/passthroughdevices/) will still need to configure those.

* [[Recommended settings]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/main/config/customconfig/recommended.zip) - These are the settings used for the recommended specs listed in [[requirements]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/requirements/).
* [[Minimum settings]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/main/config/customconfig/minimum.zip) - These are the settings used for the minimum specs listed in [[requirements]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/requirements/).

## How to
To use these, **click on the settings you want to download then extract the ZIP archives in the folder where you extracted RPCS3**. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.  
In the GIF example below, the "Recommended" requirements settings archive (recommended.zip) was downloaded and its contents were moved into RPCS3's folder.
