While Quick Configuration should work in most cases, some users might want to squeeze more fidelity or performance out of their game or prefer setting everything up themselves. This involves creating or editing a Custom Configuration for Rock Band 3.

## Creating a Custom Configuration

If you don't have a Custom Configuration yet, **right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on "**Create Custom Configuration From Default Settings**".

## Changing a Custom Configuration

If you're editing a Custom Configuration, **right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on "**Change Custom Configuration**".

## Color Guide

This may seem overwhelming because of the sheer number of options, but I have color-coded the settings that require adjustment. Anything not colored should be left alone.

| COLOR | MEANING |
|---|---|
| ![A green square with a dashed outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/biggreen.png "Green Square") | **REQUIRED** |
| ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/bigblue.png "Blue Square") | **Performance Tweaks** |
| ![A tan square with a solid outline.](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/images/cust/bigtan.png "Tan Square") | **Recommended** |
