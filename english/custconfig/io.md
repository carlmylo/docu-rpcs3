**This section is for people playing with USB/MIDI Keyboards, Pro Guitars, or MIDI Drums!**
* **If you're not playing with a wired Pro Guitar, Pro Drums, or a USB/MIDI keyboard,** [[**skip** over **this section**].](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/custom_config_net)  
* **If you're playing with a PS3 Rock Band 3 Keyboard or wireless PS3 Mustang Pro Guitar,** [[**skip** over **this section**].](https://carlmylo.github.io/docu-rpcs3/custom_config_net)  

**If your keyboard has a USB port**, all you need to do is **plug it into your computer**.

**If your keyboard only has a MIDI output, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.

**The same applies to Rock Band 3 Pro Guitars** as they only have MIDI outputs. However, **they require a MIDI to USB interface with SYSEX support.**

Here's an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity. **To check that you've plugged it in correctly, you should see "MIDI In" blinking when you press a key**.

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs. For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.

**If everything's connected**, let's go ahead and **focus on RPCS3's I/O tab.**
**YOU MAY HAVE TO MAKE THE WINDOW WIDER TO READ THE OPTIONS!**
