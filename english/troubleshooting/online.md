<li>Port 9103 is blocked.

<li>Rock Band 3 online lobbies can only have 2 slots of Guitar/Bass/Keys, one Drums slot, and one Vocal slot.<br>

<li>Double check to make sure your connection is stable. Try connecting via Ethernet cable if possible. If you have increased your VBlank past 60 Hz, set it back to 60 Hz. Aside from that, there’s not much that can be done aside from getting better internet.</li>
