## My Deluxe settings are not saving.
* You set "**Confirm DX Settings Save**" to **Off**. Reenable it in Menu > Options > Deluxe Settings > Advanced > Functional Options > Confirm DX Settings Save.

## I ruined the track camera settings.
 * Restarting the game will reset them back to normal.

                                This seems to vary by controller. Try using the whammy or effects switch if you have it. I’d also suggest doing any sort of character customization on a typing keyboard or a regular game controller as some instrument controllers don’t have enough buttons to use the on-screen keyboard. You can also try disabling the Native Interface as mentioned in <a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#emulator">[the Emulator section of Custom Configuration]</a>.
