                                This seems to vary by controller. Try using the whammy or effects switch if you have it. I'd also suggest doing any sort of character customization on a typing keyboard or a regular game controller as some instrument controllers don't have enough buttons to use the on-screen keyboard. You can also try disabling the Native Interface as mentioned in [[the Emulator section of Custom Configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#emulator).

                                You did [[controller configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/controllers/) for a PS3 Rock Band controller, which usually isn't needed due to passthrough. Just unbind the controller and it should be fine.

                                This is an infamous Rock Band 3 bug called the "double cymbal glitch" and plagues all versions of Rock Band 3, even console versions. You can try to slightly [[flam]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_rudiment#Flam) the two inputs to get around this.
