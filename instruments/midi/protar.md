## NOTES

* There is no binding file.
* **Do NOT map this instrument via Gamepad Configuration.**
* **Requires a MIDI to USB Interface that has SYSEX support!** Consult your MIDI to USB interface's manual or manufacturer for more details.
	* The M-Audio Midisport Uno is recommended as it has been verified to work.
* This is meant for players that have their PRO Guitars connected via a MIDI to USB interface.
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) will cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a typing keyboard or a gamepad.
